    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>The main purpose of this tool is to create paper backups in form of a QR code. You can create a QR of any text you like,
        just test the QR for long text. QR has capacity limit and with added excryption the resulting data is longer than
        the plain text input.</p>
    <p>Please read below to have better understanding of the whole.</p>

        <p class="q">
            <b>Q: </b>
            What type of encryption?
        </p>
        <p class="a">
            <b>A: </b>
            The encryption used is AES-256-CBC, the highest grade know today, but your QR is only as safe as your passphrase so make
            sure you have at least 7 words or 25 mixed characters.

            <b>Q: </b>
            If I encrypt my data and this tool dissaperas from existance is my data lost?
        </p>
        <p class="a">
            <b>A: </b>
            Your data is encrypted with JavaScript implementation of OpenSSL, and this means you can use OpenSSL to decrypt your QR text
            without this tool. When you scan your QR just put the text into
            <i>encrypted.txt</i>

            This is just plain text QR generator in case you want to create a QR that is not encrypted.

        <p class="q">
            <b>Q: </b>
            I scanned the QR and placed contents to a file, tried to decrypt manually via openssl and got "error reading input file".
            What am I doin wrong?
        </p>
        <p class="a">
            <b>A: </b>
            If during creation of a QR you selected "Embed Label in the QR", you need to grab only the text under "-ENC BLOCK-"

            <b>Q: </b>
            Can I trust this tool won't steal my secrets?
        </p>
        <p class="a">
            <b>A: </b>
            The rule is you can't trust anybody. I developed this tool for myself and reviewed all the libraries used here to not cointain
            AJAX the XMLHttpRequest Object that could potentially send any info out.
            <br>
            <br> Saying so you must watch out for other things. While this tool can be used online from http://qr.greenhex.net
            and considered safe, any keyloger you may have on your machine can steal your passphrase. Also the site could
            get hacked and malicious JS injected. So the safest is to download the source code from github and run on the
            offline linux machine.

            When I'm offline how can I print?

        <p class="a">
            <b>A: </b>
            You can be connected directly to the printer only, or you can save the QR as image or HTML and transfer it to any other device
            for printing.

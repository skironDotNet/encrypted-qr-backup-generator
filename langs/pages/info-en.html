        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>The main purpose of this tool is to create backups on a paper in form of a QR code. You can create a QR of any text,
            please test the QR for long text. QR has capacity limit and after the encryption the resulting data is longer
            than the plain text input.</p>
        <p>Please read below to have better understanding of the whole.</p>

                <b>Q: </b>
                What type of encryption?
            </p>
            <p class="a">
                <b>A: </b>
                The encryption algorithm used is AES-256-CBC, the highest grade known today, but your QR is only as safe as your passphrase
                so make sure you have at least 7 words or 25 mixed characters.

                <b>Q: </b>
                If I encrypt my data and this tool will cease to exist, will my data be lost?

                Your data is encrypted with JavaScript implementation of OpenSSL, and this means you can use OpenSSL to decrypt your QR text
                without this tool. When you scan your QR just put the text into a file
                <i>encrypted.txt</i>

                This is just a QR generator for a plain text, in case you want to create a QR that is not encrypted.

                I scanned the QR and placed contents to a file, tried to decrypt manually via openSSL and got "error reading input file".

                If during creation of a QR you selected "Embed Label in the QR", you need to use only the text under "-ENC BLOCK-"

                <b>Q: </b>
                Can I trust this tool it won't steal my secrets?

                <b>A: </b>
                The rule is that you can not trust anyone. I developed this tool for myself and looked at all the libraries used here, if they don't contain an AJAX, the XMLHttpRequest object that could potentially send any information.
                <br>
                <br> However, you must watch out for other things. Despite this tool can be used online from http://qr.greenhex.net
                and considered safe, any keyloger you may have on your machine can steal your passphrase. Also the site could
                get hacked and malicious JavaScript code injected. So the safest is to download the source code from GitHub
                and run on the offline linux machine.

                You can be connected directly to the printer only, or you can save the QR as image or HTML and transfer it using USB drive to any other device you can print from.
